## Notes / links about installing React Native:
[A great guide to setting up your environment!](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)

Make sure you have Node.JS installed before attempting this, or it will not work!

In order to install the "Expo CLI command-line utility" (a program you need to run simulations of your app) run the following in your Command Prompt:
> npm install -g expo-cli
**Note: running these commands in Git Bash will NOT work!** I have tried.

> expo init AwesomeProject
> 
> cd AwesomeProject
> 
then to launch the app, use `npm start` or `expo start` starts the task
