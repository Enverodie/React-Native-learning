# This is the collaborative repo for all React and React Native notes, code snippets, etc.
## Please contribute to the effort! Every little bit helps.

## Goals for the end of the semester:
* Every member of our group has a working React Native application (of their choosing, though it would be ideal to work on generally the same thing)
* Every member of our group has a general understanding of the utility of the React and React Native JavaScript libraries, when, and how to use them.
* Every member does something they can be proud of, something they can use to build their resume, portfolio, or LinkedIn profile.
