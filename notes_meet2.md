npx create-react-app "appname" - This will set up all of the React dependencies, the src folder, and everything else you need to get started. It's actually crazy simple to set up.

If you don't have npm installed, you have to install it first!

Any JavaScript file you want to be rendered with React.js must be exported using export default NameOfMainClassorFunction.
It must then be imported into App.js or equivalent parent script using import NameOfMainClassorFunction from './NameOfScript'
